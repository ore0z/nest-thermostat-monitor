# Nest Thermostat Monitor

A simple script to monitor my HVAC equipment is working properly (actually cooling and heating).

### Requirements

This scritp needs a local redis instance running to temporarily store tempature data.

This also uses Pushover to send notifications to your phone. You'll need to set up an account and create an API key.
